# Questions about Problems and Recipes

[Ch.4, Problem 1]
* Question (mgutierrez67-stat697): Is there a way to overlay the column of the second table instead without changing the order the tables are referenced in the select statement?

[Ch.4, Problem 2]
* Question (mgutierrez67-stat697): Should an outer union or union all be used if the goal is to vertically join two tables with the assumption that both tables contain the same columns?

[Ch.4, Problem 4]
* Question (mgutierrez67-stat697): What are some practical advantages for overlaying columns? 

[Ch.4, Problem 4]
* Question (mgutierrez67-stat697): Doesnâ€™t overlaying columns increase the possibility of assigning values from a different column unintentionally when using one of the set operators?

[Ch.11, Problem 1]
* Question (mgutierrez67-stat697): Other than readability, what are some cons of not including the macro-name in a %MEND statement?

[Ch.11, Problem 5]
* Question (mgutierrez67-stat697): Is the macro program comparable to a user created function in other languages (i.e. creating a function, calling function etc.)?
- Answer (mgutierrez67-stat697): Yes, per weekly recipe video, but there are differences in how the program is ran and returned (i.e. macros do not have a return value like other languages). 

[Ch.11, Problem 10]
* Question (mgutierrez67-stat697): Is it best and/or common practice to include a MCOMPILENOTE when a program containing a macro is ran?

[advanced-dry-programming-pattern Week 4 SAS Recipe]
* Question (mgutierrez67-stat697): Should symbolgen always be used when running a program with macros? Is it good practice to review the log after using the symbolgen, even if there are numerous macro references and can potentially become time consuming?

*modified the code by removing the three global system options to compare the log output with the program that retains the global options
*the log with the global system options is much more informative and allows the user to follow how macro variables were handled/assigned
*even though it global system options add additional insight, it might become more time consuming and daunting to review as the number of macros to review increases
