* [SAS Recipe 1:  obtain-column-information;

*Example For Approach 1;
proc sql;
	select
		  Species
		 ,SepalLength
		 ,SepalWidth
		 ,PetalLength
		 ,PetalWidth
	from
		sashelp.iris
	;
quit;


*Example For Approach 2;
proc contents order=varnum data=sashelp.iris;
run;

proc sql;
	select
 		 Species
		,SepalLength
		,SepalWidth
		,PetalLength
		,PetalWidth
	from
		sashelp.iris
	;
quit;


*Example For Approach 3;
proc sql;
	select
		name
	from
		dictionary.columns
	where
		lowcase(libname) = "sashelp"
		and
		lowcase(memname) = "iris"

		 Species 
		,SepalLength 
		,SepalWidth 
		,PetalLength 
		,PetalWidth 
	from
		sashelp.iris

/* Notes:
 - it doesn't matter which approach is used 
to get the same list of columns as quickly as possible.
